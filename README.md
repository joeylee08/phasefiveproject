## Project Description

This SPA [single page application] is a React / Flask app that allows businesses, namely restaurants and grocers, to post listings of surplus food for users to come pick up for free. Individuals can create an account as either a user or business. Users can browse and save listings, while businesses can create and edit listings. Listings are location-based and can be filtered for specific dietary restrictions.
